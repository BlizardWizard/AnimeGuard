# AnimeGuard

Uses Discord API to collect chat messages and information sent through connected servers. Then, the bot will look into a filter list of all words selected by server admins on that server, and remove the message if it matches any part of that list. Also has various other commands for general ease of use and quality of life in managing a Discord server.

Learned about using an API, and looking through documentation of other libraries. Also learned about using puthon to create, store, and modify local files to keep track of information.
